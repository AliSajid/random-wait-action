# Project Governance Model

## Overview

This document outlines how decisions are made for this project, defines the roles of contributors, and establishes how conflicts are resolved.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Owner

The Project Owner currently makes all final decisions on the project's direction, design, and functionality. This role is responsible for:

-   Approving or rejecting contributions (such as pull requests)
-   Setting the project roadmap and priorities
-   Managing project releases
-   Resolving disputes or conflicting opinions

### Contributors

Contributors are anyone who submits code, documentation, or other changes to the project. Contributions are made via pull requests and are subject to review by the Project Owner. Contributors:

-   Suggest improvements to the project
-   Participate in discussions and feedback sessions
-   Submit code, documentation, or bug reports

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions are currently made by the Project Owner based on project needs, feedback from contributors, and long-term project vision. As the project grows, decision-making may evolve to include more collaborative processes.

## Conflict Resolution

If disagreements arise, the Project Owner will have the final say. The Project Owner will take into account all feedback and suggestions before making a decision.

## Future Governance Changes

As the project grows and gains more contributors, the governance model may shift to include a more formal process, such as meritocracy or group maintainers, to better accommodate additional contributors. Any changes to this governance structure will be reflected in this document.
