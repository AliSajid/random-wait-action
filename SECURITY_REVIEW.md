# Security Review Document

Review Conducted: 2025-02-26

Reviewer: @AliSajid

## Code Overview

The provided code is a GitHub Actions script written in TypeScript.
The script retrieves two input values (`minimum` and `maximum`), waits for a
random amount of time between these values, and sets an output variable with
the number of seconds waited.

## Review Steps

1. **Dependency Review**: The first step is to review any 3rd Party Code that is
included in the scripts.
<!-- vale alex.ProfanityMaybe = NO -->
1. **Input Validation**: We checked the inputs for possible ways the inputs
can be utilized as attack vectors.
<!-- vale alex.ProfanityMaybe = YES -->
1. **Random Number Generation**: The script includes generation of random
   integers. This necessitated the
   review of methods used to generate these random numbers.
1. **Error Handling**: We analyzed how errors are handled within the code,
   including any potential issues with error messages revealing sensitive
   information or exceptions being thrown
   without proper handling.

## Findings

### Dependency Review

The GitHub Action has minimal dependencies. The only runtime dependency is
the first-party `@actions/core` npm package. We verified that the dependency
was authentic and sourced directly from GitHub

### Input Validation

We examined how input values are validated and sanitized within the code.
Specifically, we looked for any potential issues with user-controlled data being used
in sensitive operations or calculations.
The two input values are validated for the following conditions:

- `minimum` and `maximum` are both numbers
- `minimum` is strictly less than `maximum`
- Both `minimum` and `maximum` are less than the limit of 100

### Random Number Generation

The script uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number of seconds to wait
between the specified minimum and maximum values. We reviewed the
documentation for `Math.random()` to ensure it is suitable for generating
cryptographically secure random numbers.

`Math.random()` is not considered suitable for generating
cryptographically secure random numbers. However, in this context
(waiting for a random amount of time), it's likely sufficient. However, if
security requirements demand higher entropy, consider using a more robust
random number generator like
`crypto.getRandomValues()`.

### Error Handling

The script provides robust error handling, setting a descriptive error message
and setting the action as failed.

## Recommendations

No major recommendations are warranted.

## Conclusion

<!-- vale alex.ProfanityMaybe = NO -->

This is a very small and simple project. However, it still provides an attack
surface as it is exposed to quasi-trusted input from the end user. This
review has found no major weaknesses in the software that could be exploited
to create a security issue.
