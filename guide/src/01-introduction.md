This is a very simple GitHub action that lets you wait for a random amount of
time in seconds. This is useful for workflows that have to deal with external APIs with rate-limiting
or steps where you have to let an external process complete.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

I created this action to fix a problem I was having with my own workflows.
I ran a build job for which I wanted to have individual results for each build.
For this purpose, I opted to use the excellent
[`schneegans/dynamic-badges-action`](https://github.com/schneegans/dynamic-badges-action)
to generate a badge for each build. This action updates a file in a specified
[Gist](https://gist.github.com), which can then be consumed by [Shields.io](https://shields.io)
to generate a specific badge.

This appeared to be a simple solution. However, I kept running into 500
errors from the GitHub Gist API. I theorized that the API was
probably rate limiting me because I was hitting it with twelve requests at the same time.
When I tried to find something that would let me add a some kind of non-identical delay
after the build but before the `dynamic-badges-action` fires. I could not find
one, so I decided to create this one.

## Broad Design Decisions

This is an extremely simple action. In fact, it is not much different from the
default action that is in the GitHub node-based actions template repository.

The action has no required inputs because we don't need any. By default, it waits
between 1 and 10 seconds. If that proves insufficient, the action allows for
customizing these values.

The action has one output: The number of seconds the action waited.
